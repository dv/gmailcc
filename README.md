Gmail Carbon Copy
=================

Gmailcc makes it possible to backup your Gmail account to a Maildir format usable by any standard IMAP-server.

It detects mails with multiple labels and will save only one copy of each, using a link for very duplicate. This achieves maximum space savings while still allowing an IMAP-server to find the mail with every label. Combine with Webmail software like Roundcube for optimum results.

Installation & Usage
--------------------
Info on how to install and use it can be found [on the project site](http://code.crowdway.com/projects/show/gmailcc "Gmail Carbon Copy - Tutorial").
